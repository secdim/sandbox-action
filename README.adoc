[abstract]
SecDim Sandbox supercharges your security CI/CD by transforming static SARIF findings into interactive, containerized labs. Turn every vulnerability into a hands-on learning adventure—complete with AI-powered hints, real-world exploitation tests, and patch validation.

* **Instant Hands-On Labs** – Each finding links to a fully containerized demo you can spin up in seconds.
* **Real Attacker Simulations** – Built-in tests show you exactly how bad actors exploit each flaw.
* **AI Sidekick** – Our AI code assistant gives you context, hints, and validation feedback.
* **Seamless Privacy** – Only minimal metadata (e.g., CWE IDs) leaves your repo; your source code stays local.
* **Zero Config** – Works out of the box with any SARIF-producing tool (Semgrep, CodeQL, etc.).

== ✨ Key Features
- **SARIF Enrichment**: Scans your SARIF, enriches each finding with a lab link.
- **Catalog Lookup**: Queries the https://play.secdim.com/browse[SecDim Wargame catalog] for the best matching challenge.
- **Security Tab Integration**: Results appear right in your repo’s Security tab.
- **Customizable Templates**: Override lab URLs, link labels, or categories via inputs.
- **Cross-Scanner Support**: Plug into Semgrep, CodeQL, Sonar, and many others.

== 🔒 Privacy & Security

[NOTE]
====
Your source code never leaves your environment. We only parse rule metadata (e.g., CWE IDs) and send tiny search queries to SecDim APIs. All heavy lifting stays in your CI runner.
