= SecDim Sandbox Action

== Description

This Github Action will take a SARIF file, search SecDim for the relevant vulnerability sandboxes, and upload a new SARIF file detailing the vulnerabilities with links to the relevant sandboxes to explore.

See https://github.com/secdim/sandbox-semgrep-example[our example repository] to see it in action. This repository will be scanned by Semgrep and output a SARIF file. This SARIF file is then process by our https://github.com/secdim/sandbox-sarif-parser[Sandbox SARIF Parser], with the results uploaded to the repository so you can view them in the repository's Security tab.

Alternatively, the YAML workflow file from https://github.com/secdim/sandbox-semgrep-example[the example repository] is included below:
