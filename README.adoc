= SecDim Sandbox

SecDim Sandbox is a Cloud Development Environment where you can explore a real vulnerability in a cloud native app. Each Sandbox comes with a security test suit to simulate the exploitation of the vulnerability. This can help you to debug and verify if your security patch can remediate the vulnerability.

== Description

This Github Action will take a SARIF file, search https://play.secdim.com/sandbox[SecDim Sandbox] for the relevant Sandbox, and upload a new SARIF file detailing the vulnerabilities with links to the relevant https://play.secdim.com/sandbox/[SecDim Sandbox]. The results can be viewed in the repository's Security tab.

See an example of using this Github Action with Semgrep: https://github.com/secdim/sandbox-semgrep-example[Integrating Semgrep with SecDim Sandbox]

== Your Privacy and Security

Your code is not send to SecDim APIs. The SARIF file rule section is parsed for relevant search terms (e.g. CWE ids), and only these search terms are queries on SecDim API. No information about the origin is sent to SecDim.
